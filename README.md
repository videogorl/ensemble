## Architecture

Ensemble uses a **layered modular architecture** with Swift Package Manager:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│      EnsembleUI                 │  SwiftUI views & components
│      (Layer 3)                  │
└────────────┬────────────────────┘
             │
┌────────────▼────────────────────┐
│      EnsembleCore               │  ViewModels, services, domain models
│      (Layer 2)                  │
└────────┬───────────────┬────────┘
         │               │
┌────────▼────────┐ ┌───▼─────────────┐
│  EnsembleAPI    │ │ EnsemblePersist │  Networking & data

```

### Package Overview

| Package | Purpose | Key Components |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **EnsembleAPI** | Plex networking & auth | `PlexAPIClient` (with timeline/scrobble support), `PlexAuthService`, `KeychainService`, `ConnectionFailoverManager` |
| **EnsemblePersistence** | CoreData & downloads | `CoreDataStack`, `LibraryRepository`, `HubRepository`, `DownloadManager`, `ArtworkDownloadManager` |
| **EnsembleCore** | Business logic | `DependencyContainer`, `SyncCoordinator`, `PlaybackService` (with playback tracking), `PlexAccountDiscoveryService`, `LibraryVisibilityStore`, `ArtworkLoader`, `NetworkMonitor`, `ServerHealthChecker`, `SettingsManager`, `NavigationCoordinator`, `HubOrderManager`, ViewModels |
| **EnsembleUI** | User interface | `RootView`, `HomeView` (with `HubSection`/`HubItemCard`), `MediaDetailView`, `MiniPlayer`, `FilterSheet`, `ArtworkView`, `DetailLoaders`, `CoverFlowView`, `HubOrderingSheet`, `ArtworkColorExtractor`, `WaveformView`, `MarqueeText` |

### Key Design Patterns
- **MVVM** with `@MainActor` ObservableObject ViewModels
- **Dependency Injection** via centralized `DependencyContainer`
- **Repository Pattern** for CoreData access
- **Actor-based networking** for thread safety
- **Protocol-based view reuse** — Single detail view for multiple content types
- **Multi-source architecture** — Designed to support multiple services (Plex, future Apple Music, etc.)
- **Network resilience** — Multi-layered connectivity monitoring with automatic failover
- **Persistent artwork caching** — Two-tier caching (filesystem + memory) with local-first loading
- **Performance optimizations** — Debouncing, background processing, memory-efficient design
- **iOS 15 compatibility layer** — NestedNavigationLink pattern, traditional NavigationLink fallbacks, conditional feature checks

```

### Code Guidelines
- **Target:** iOS 15+ devices with 2GB RAM
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Comment logical sections (not every line)
- Favor simplicity over premature optimization
- App is in active beta testing — handle edge cases defensively, especially in CoreData model

### Adding New Features
See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed development guidelines, including:
- How to add ViewModels, Views, and CoreData entities
- Multi-source architecture patterns
- Memory optimization tips

## External Dependencies

| Library | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) | 12.0+ | High-performance image loading & caching |
| [KeychainAccess](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/KeychainAccess) | 4.2+ | Secure token storage |

## Known Issues

- **watchOS (deferred as of February 21, 2026):** Authentication path references missing `AuthViewModel`, so the watch target does not currently compile/run.
  - iOS/macOS remediation is prioritized first; watchOS restoration is intentionally out of scope for this pass.
- **Background continued processing limits (iOS 26+):** `BGContinuedProcessingTask` is best-effort; queued requests can be rejected or canceled by the system, and the app falls back to the persistent in-app queue.
- **Artwork Pre-Caching:** Methods exist but not automatically called during sync
- **Visibility Profile UI:** `LibraryVisibilityProfile` groundwork is implemented, but profile selector/editor UI is not shipped yet

## Development Status

**Current Phase:** Feature-rich MVP with advanced functionality and Plex ecosystem integration

**Completed:**
- Multi-library Plex support with network resilience
- Hub-based home screen with offline-first loading and DetailLoader pattern
