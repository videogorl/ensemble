# On Deck

Things agents notice outside their task: bugs, workarounds, over-complex code, a native
API that would replace custom machinery. Each entry gives evidence, impact and a next
step, and says whether it is suspected or confirmed. Remove an entry when it is fixed.
An entry does not authorize the work; Felicity picks what gets done.

## Suspected: other EnsembleCore tests fail under heavy host load (2026-11-10)

- Evidence: with the Mac at load average 400-800 (other simulators and builds), three full
  `swift test` runs executed 1187 tests with 5, 1 and 1 failures, a different set each time:
  `AudioPlaybackEngineStreamingTests.testStreamingFailureAfterFormatReadyReachesEngineErrorHandler`
  (1 s `fulfillment`), `DownloadQueueCoordinatorTests.testQueueLoopRestartsWhenMorePendingWorkArrivesDuringWindDown`,
  `HomeViewModelRefreshPolicyTests.testLibraryDataClearInvalidatesLateCachedRestore` and
  `testSourceChangeDuringActiveLoadFlushesAfterLoadCompletes` (1 s `fulfillment`),
  `AccountManagerAuthPolicyTests.testAsyncCredentialLoadTimesOutWithoutBlockingCachedFallback`
  (elapsed-time bound) and `NowPlayingViewModelFavoriteTests.testPlaybackProjectionTracksSmartMixTransitionState`
  (fixed `waitForProjectionPropagation`). None touched the tests fixed in this change.
- Impact: the full suite is not a reliable gate while the host is busy.
- Next step: rerun on an idle Mac to separate load from real defects; widen the 1 s waits to
  event-based waits with a long timeout.

## Confirmed: excessive disk writes on the iPhone SE 2 (2026-08-10 report, noted 2026-11-10)

- Evidence: a disk-writes resource report, 1,073 MB in 107 minutes. 37 of 66 samples are an
  Ensemble async task into a Foundation file write (frames unsymbolicated, writer unknown);
  15 of 66 are Core Data saves. See
  `docs/investigations/2026-11-10-crash-evidence-and-library-writer.md`, report 6.
- Impact: battery and storage wear, and iOS can penalize the app. The step 3 shared writer
  should cut the Core Data share (it skips unchanged rows); the larger file-write share is
  not explained.
- Next step: symbolicate the report (needs the dSYM for TestFlight build `…0709`), or
  measure writes by subsystem on a device with Instruments File Activity during a sync and
  a streaming session. Suspects: stream cache, offline downloads, the session log file.

## Suspected: EnsembleCore's tests are heavier than they need to be (2026-11-10)

- Evidence: about 40,000 lines of tests against 70,000 of source in `EnsembleCore`. Three
  entries above are flaky or racy tests, and several pin internals such as private state.
- Impact: slow full runs, ambiguous failures, and tests that must be rewritten on every
  refactor without protecting behaviour.
- Next step: per the plan's test policy, list tests that pin internals or duplicate another
  test's behaviour class, by file, and propose deletions or table-driven merges.

## Confirmed: the Mac app opens no window without `-ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES` (2026-11-09)

- Evidence: launching the built `.app` on this Mac showed no window until that flag was
  passed; stale window-restoration state is the suspected cause.
- Impact: a user with the same saved state would see the app launch with nothing on screen.
- Next step: reproduce with the saved state kept, then check the scene and
  restoration setup.

## Confirmed: a track that appears twice in a detail list plays its first occurrence (2026-11-09)

- Evidence: seen while checking playlist detail on the simulator; tapping the second copy
  starts the queue at the first.
- Impact: wrong start position in playlists that repeat a track.
- Next step: start playback from the tapped row's index, not a lookup by track id.

## Suspected: playback slot held through a stream-retry reload (2026-11-09)

- Evidence: read from the code during the playback failure work; same on `develop` before it.
- Impact: unknown; may delay a user action that arrives during the reload.
- Next step: fold into the stream drop recovery design
  (`docs/investigations/2026-11-10-stream-drop-recovery-and-fallback.md`, in progress).

## Unchecked: gap above the Favorites header on Mac (2026-11-09)

- Evidence: reported by a Mac check worker; not looked at again.
- Next step: open Favorites on the Mac and compare the header spacing with Album detail.
